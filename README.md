🛡️ iCivic Guardian
AI-Powered Digital Watchdog for Smart & Safe Cities

“From reporting civic issues to predicting them — iCivic Guardian transforms citizens into guardians of their city.”

🚀 About the Project

iCivic Guardian is a next-generation AI + MERN based civic-tech platform that empowers citizens to report, track, and resolve civic issues while helping governments predict, prioritize, and prevent problems before they escalate.

Unlike traditional complaint portals, iCivic Guardian combines AI/ML intelligence, real-time analytics, and community-driven verification to create a transparent, fast, and accountable civic ecosystem.

This project is designed to be hackathon-ready, scalable, and impactful, making it perfect for Smart City, GovTech, AI, Sustainability, and Social Impact hackathons.
